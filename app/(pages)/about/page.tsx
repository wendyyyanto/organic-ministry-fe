						Organic Ministry was established around 2013, starting
						from a married couple with two children who had a heart
						for reaching out to young people, especially university
						students around the Gading Serpong area. The desire to
						carry out evangelism and discipleship came from their
						experience as leaders in a fellowship called ICF in
						Columbus, Ohio, and from witnessing how God worked
						miraculously through Xenos Christian Fellowship.
					</p>
					<p className="text-xl font-normal text-justify w-full">
						Organic Ministry was founded because of new souls being
						won for Christ, and these young people committed to
						growing in community, even being mentored through
						personal discipleship. From one university student to
						another, God kept adding to our numbers. Today, God has
						blessed us with 6 leaders and 2 Home Churches. One of
						our methods to reach out and grow in character is
						through the Ministry House, which God continues to
						use—now we have 3 Ministry Houses.

						Organic Ministry is a non-traditional and
						non-denominational House Church that emphasizes
						evangelism and discipleship through a loving community.

					<p className="text-xl font-normal text-justify w-full">
						We believe in the Great Commission as written in Matthew
						28:19–20 (NKJV): “Go therefore and make disciples of all
						the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father
						and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to
						observe all things that I have commanded you; and lo, I
						am with you always, even to the end of the age.” We also
						believe that to reach and disciple others effectively, a
						loving Christian community is essential, as written in
						John 13:35 (NKJV): “By this all will know that you are
						My disciples, if you have love for one another.”
					</p>
					<p className="text-xl font-normal text-justify w-full">
						We hold Bible Study sessions during our Medium Group
						(MG) and Central Teaching (CT) every Thursday at 7:30 PM
						(WIB).
